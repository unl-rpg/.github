The UNL Rocket Propulsion Group (UNL RPG) is a team from the UNL Aerospace Club focused on the development and research of solid propellant rocket motors. The team's goal is to eventually participate in the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) in the Student Research and Design category. Recently, RPG has been focusing on designing and building their first rocket motor using the Cherry Limeade formula from MIT, as well as setting up their testing and mixing sites.
